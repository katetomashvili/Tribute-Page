                2010-2015: The X Factor and One Direction
            </h1>

                Following a suggestion from his mother, on 11 April 2010, Styles auditioned as a 
                solo contestant for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor, 
                singing a rendition of Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely"
                He advanced to bootcamp, but failed to progress further. Four others in his age group also failed, 
                but they were put together as an ensemble in July 2010, during the bootcamp stage of the competition, 
                thus qualifying for the "Groups" category mentored by Simon Cowell.
                The group consisting of Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, got together 
                for two weeks to practise.Styles said he had suggested the name One Direction to his bandmates and they agreed to keep it.
                They began to gain considerable popularity in the UK,and within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition.
                The group eventually reached The X Factor final, and finished in third place.

                In January 2011, One Direction signed a recording contract with Cowell's label Syco Records.
                "What Makes You Beautiful", and their debut studio album, Up All Night, followed later that year.
                The album contained three songs co-written by Styles, and made One Direction the first British group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.
                Their four succeeding studio albums, Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014) and Made in the A.M. (2015), all debuted at number one in the UK.
                Midnight Memories was the world's best-selling album of 2013,[25] and its accompanying Where We Are Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2014 and remains the highest-grossing
                tour of all time by a vocal group. After the release of Four, One Direction became the only group in the 58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.
                The albums spawned a string of successful singles, including "Live While We're Young", "Little Things", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life", "Drag Me Down" and "History".
