            <p class="biography-p">Harry Edward Styles was born on February 1, 1994, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, 
                in the West Midlands region of England. His parents, Des and Anne, divorced when he was 7 years old.
                He and his sister Gemma were brought up by their mother in the town of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire.
                His mother was later remarried, to Robin Twist.
            </p> 
            <p class="biography-p">   
                Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he and three of his friends formed a band called White Eskimo.
                Styles was White Eskimo's lead singer, and the band was popular enough to win a band competition at their school. 
                After school and on weekends, Styles worked at the W. Mandeville bakery in Holmes Chapel.
